Objective: Implement conditional statements for decision-making
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that determines if a given year is a leap year. Prompt the user for a year and display a message on the console indicating whether it is a leap year or not.

Exercise 9
Objective: Control program flow using loops
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that calculates and displays the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a while loop.

Exercise 10
Objective: Work with data types and variables in JavaScript
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on those numbers. Display the results on the console.

Exercise #11: Basic
Aim: Create a variable for every JavaScript Data Type
[ ] Create a variable that holds a string value
[ ] Create a variable that holds a number value
[ ] Create a variable that holds a boolean value
[ ] Create a variable that holds a null value
[ ] Create a variable that holds an undefined value
[ ] Create a variable that points to an object instance
[ ] Create a variable that points to an array instance
[ ] Create a variable that has no default value declaration

Exercise #12: Intermediate
Aim: Dynamically display a list of food items and prices using HTML & JavaScript
[ ] Create a LIST of OBJECTS, each object having a name and price property
[ ] LOOP over that LIST, dynamically create a new list item li with the food name inside, and append that item to an existing HTML ul element

Exercise #13: Advanced
Aim: Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.
Examples
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5)    ➞    [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]
arrayOfMultiples(12, 10)    ➞    [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]
arrayOfMultiples(17, 6)    ➞    [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
Notes
Notice that num included in the returned array.

Exercise #14: Intermediate
Objective: Implement conditional statements for decision-making
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. Display a message on the console indicating the type of the number.

Exercise #15: Intermediate
Objective: Control program flow using loops
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that displays the multiplication table of a number up to 10 using a for loop.

Exercise #16: Advanced
*Aim: Create a function that checks if a given number is prime.
Examples
isPrime(2)    ➞    true
isPrime(15)    ➞    false
isPrime(13)    ➞    true
